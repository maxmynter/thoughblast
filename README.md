# Thought Blast

Hi, I was developing Thought Blast during the Nights&Weekends bootcamp by [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/).

The goal was to develop and ship an app and incorporate user feedback to  make it better. 

It features submission, editing and deleting of thoughts in the app as well as audio capturing and transcription by the backend. 

It used to feature tags, but I removed them based on user feedback. 

While I set out to make a notes app that works better for me than apple notes, I realised in the process that apple notes is a pretty mature product (duh!) and it's shortcomings are necessary design trade offs. 

### Technologies
- React Native
- Expo
- Redux
- REST APIs

And with the [backend](https://github.com/maxmynter/ThoughblastFlaskBackend)
